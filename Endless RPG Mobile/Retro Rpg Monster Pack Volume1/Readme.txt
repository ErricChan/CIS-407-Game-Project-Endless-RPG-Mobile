-Some General Tips 

As default I suggest to set a Duration of 150-200ms between frames but you can change it as you like

-Special Hurt Animation

for the special hurt animation i suggest you to set the second,third and forth frame to roughly 1/3 of duration of the first

example:
1:333 ms
2:100 ms
3:100 ms
4:100 ms
5:333 ms

if you the engine of your choice has not the option to set a duration in ms but only the amount of sprites just copy the first and last frame 3 times more than the 2-3-4th

-Death Animation
it's a fading animation so last frame should be empty
