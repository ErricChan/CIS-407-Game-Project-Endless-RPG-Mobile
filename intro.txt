This is a CIS 407 game project using Corona 2D.

This game is a endless RPG battle game app, which pits you against
an endless wave of monsters. You face them one at a time, but each
monster is stronger than the last. Luckily, you can upgrade yourself
for every monster you kill (to a certain extent). Attack while watching
your health, as well as heal yourself based on the situation! 
Currently, there is 6 unique monsters you can face in this game and you can
get your kills in the high score board whenever you die.

Note: If you close the game during gameplay, your kill count will reset...
